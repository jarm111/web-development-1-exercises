# Summary of Angular vs React & Angular1.x

## Angular vs React

Similarities:
- UI is composed of reusable components that form a hierarchy

Differences:
- Angular is full frontend framework, React a lighter UI library
- React uses one-way data flow, Angular both one-way and two-way binding
- Angular uses separate template HTML files, React embeds document markup in JSX inside JavaScript code
- Angular's learning curve is steeper with complicated architecture and more concepts to understand
- React code typically is written in ES6 + JSX and Angular in TypeScript
- React makes data flow explicit and easy to understand but requires more typing code

## Angular vs Angular1.x (AngularJS)

Similarities:
- Both of them have some similar constructs/terms like modules, templates, directives, data binding, services, dependency injection and routing

Differences:
- New Angular is component based, AngularJS classic MVC/MVVM model
- In Angular you don't write Controllers or put variables in scope anymore
- AngularJS is a lot simpler to set up, learn and pick-up, but Angular offers more robust solution for big modern apps
